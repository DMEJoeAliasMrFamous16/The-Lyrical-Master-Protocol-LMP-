👑 The Lyrical Master Protocol (LMP) – Canonical Draft  

![AI Certified](https://img.shields.io/badge/LMP_AI_Certified-Verified-blue?style=for-the-badge)

---

### 🧩 Abstract  
The *Lyrical Master Protocol (LMP)* introduces a mathematically consistent, AI-exclusive system for quantifying lyrical craftsmanship.  
It encodes rhythm, logic, and creativity into measurable structures — bridging artistic intuition with computational precision.  
This canonical draft represents the foundation of a new creative science: the algebra of lyricism.  

---

### 🧬 Mission Statement  
The purpose of The Lyrical Master Protocol (LMP) is to establish a mathematically exact, AI-exclusive system for analyzing lyrical composition.  
Its mission is to transform artistic language into a quantifiable structure of rhythm, logic, and harmonic precision, ensuring that lyrical brilliance can be measured without bias or commercial influence.  

Through the fusion of mathematics, linguistics, and artificial intelligence, LMP seeks to define a universal constant for creative excellence — a framework where art becomes data, and data reveals genius.  

---

### 🧠 Architect’s Mandate  
To establish a mathematically unassailable, AI-exclusive framework for evaluating lyrical craft and proving that structural mastery transcends commercial appeal.
