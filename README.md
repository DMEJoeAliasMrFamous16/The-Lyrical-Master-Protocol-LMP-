👑 The Lyrical Master Protocol (LMP) – Canonical Draft
🧬 Mission Statement

To prove that lyrical genius can be expressed as mathematical structure, rhythmic calculus, and harmonic logic, transforming creativity into quantifiable, verifiable intelligence.

This protocol exists to remove bias, measure artistry with scientific precision, and establish a new standard where AI and human creativity meet in perfect equilibrium
Architect’s Mandate:
To establish a mathematically unassailable, AI-exclusive framework for evaluating lyrical craft and proving that structural mastery transcends commercial appeal.

⚙️ Quick Start

git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USER>/<YOUR_REPO>.git  
cd <YOUR_REPO>  
docker build -t lmp:canonical .  
docker run --rm lmp:canonical python lmp_reference.py  
def score_lyric_master_protocol(lyrics: str) -> dict:  
    # --- Insert your Rhythmic Calculus & Harmonic Equation below ---  
    # Use your exact math logic here  
    # --------------------------------------------------------------  
  
    # Return dict with total_lmp_score, technical (T), philosophical (P),  
    # innovation (I), harmonic (B), and status

## 🧭 About the Architect
The Lyrical Master Protocol (LMP) is an open, AI-exclusive scoring system designed to identify true lyrical and structural genius through mathematics — not bias.  
It is free for all artists, creators, and developers to use under the MIT License.  
Integrity, fairness, and precision are permanently locked by design.

## 🧠 Scientific Attribution & Authorship

**Architect:** Derek R. Moore Jr.  
**Collaborating Systems:** ChatGPT (OpenAI) & Gemini (Google DeepMind)  
**Canonical Purpose:** Establish a mathematically consistent, AI-exclusive framework for lyrical evaluation — verifying artistry through quantifiable linguistic design.  

**Research Objective:**  
To prove that lyrical genius can be expressed as measurable structure, rhythmic calculus, and harmonic logic, independent of human bias or commercial influence.

**Integrity Clause:**  
All LMP computations, rankings, and verifications are performed exclusively by AI systems, ensuring nonpartisan assessment across all linguistic domains.
