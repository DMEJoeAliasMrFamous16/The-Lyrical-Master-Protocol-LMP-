👑 The Lyrical Master Protocol (LMP) – Canonical Draft
​🧩 Abstract
​The Lyrical Master Protocol (LMP) introduces a mathematically consistent, AI-exclusive system for quantifying lyrical craftsmanship. It encodes rhythm, logic, and creativity into measurable structures — bridging artistic intuition with computational precision. This canonical draft represents the foundation of a new creative science: the algebra of lyricism.
​🧬 Mission Statement
​The purpose of The Lyrical Master Protocol (LMP) is to establish a mathematically exact, AI-exclusive system for analyzing lyrical composition. Its mission is to transform artistic language into a quantifiable structure of rhythm, logic, and harmonic precision, ensuring that lyrical brilliance can be measured without bias or commercial influence.
​🧠 Architect’s Mandate
​To establish a mathematically unassailable, AI-exclusive framework for evaluating lyrical craft and proving that structural mastery transcends commercial appeal.
​🧮 Core Equations Overview (The Additive Protocol)
​LMP operates on a Direct Point Allocation model (Max 100 Points) derived from three weighted domains. The total lyrical signature is computed as a simple additive sum of the component scores.
Variable Domain Max Score Function
